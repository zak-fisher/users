## How to develop

Build all distributed packages with `yarn build`.

Run `yarn start` to start the dev server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Things to know

- This repo contains a dev server which should be thought of as a sandbox for local development.

- This repo publishes / distributes multiple packages, which live in `src/packages`.

- Running `yarn` should install dependencies for all the packages and the dev server, but packages must be built prior to starting the server.
## How to publish
